            <h2 class="faq-question">What is DOM?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">"DOM" typically refers to the Document Object Model, which is a programming interface used to represent and manipulate HTML and XML documents. It provides a structured representation of the document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to interact with and modify the content, structure, and style of web pages using languages like JavaScript.

            <h2 class="faq-question">How do you select an element from DOM?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">To select an element from the DOM in JavaScript, you can use several methods depending on your needs. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:
            getElementById- Selects an element by its ID.getElementsByClassName-Selects all elements with a specific class name. This returns a live HTMLCollection.getElementById is best for selecting a single element by ID. getElementsByClassName and getElementsByTagName are good for selecting multiple elements but return live collections.
            querySelector and querySelectorAll offer more flexibility with CSS selectors and are generally recommended for modern JavaScript

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">What is event delegation in the context of DOM, and why it is useful?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript that allows you to manage events for multiple child elements by attaching a single event listener to a parent element. Instead of adding individual event listeners to each child, you handle events at a higher level in the DOM hierarchy.</p>

                2.Set an Attribute:

                3. Remove an Attribute:
                   Use `removeAttribute()` to remove an attribute from an element.
        
                
               
                Manipulating Styles
